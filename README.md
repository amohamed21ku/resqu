## Security Application for the Disabled People
This application should enhance the saving operation of the disabled people from a building that is in an emergency condition. The application should help the rescuers to better navigate around the building and know which people are the most vulnerable to the disasters. Besides that, we believe that the application should emphasize the communitarianism for the residents of the building by notifying the closest to the disabled person people of his/her situation during the emergency. As a result this application should allow the disabled people to feel safer and more confident that during any disaster help will be on the way.

## Key Features
- Database of the disabled people of the building. 
The database should contain the information about their disabilities and special conditions. The evacuation from a building which is in an emergency state is always a chaotic process, where “everyone's for themselves”. For this reason, the rescuers will prioritize the evacuation of those people, who are the least likely to make it out on their own. The data will allow the rescuers to quickly track the disabled people and have the most relevant info about them in front of their eyes.
- Notify the people nearby of the disabled person during the evacuation.
 As mentioned, the app should emphasize communitarianism among the neighbors. The people who live closest to the disabled person should be notified that there is a person nearby them, who might need help during the evacuation.
- 3D model of the building with the apartments of the disabled people highlighted.
Every building created has a clear model of itself (a blueprint). The blueprint of the building should be loaded into the application as a 3D model with the apartments of the disabled people highlighted for the better visuals and logistics during the saving operation
- Signaling via phone during the emergency.
During the evacuation the phone should notify the user about an emergency by signaling to him with vibrations, alert screen, and the phone lighter. The last feature would especially be useful to deaf people, who would not be able to hear the building’s siren, but could easily be notified thanks to the personal phone’s signaling.
- Notify the system of the absence of the disabled person.
If the disabled person is not at home during the emergency happening, the system should be updated with this information, so that the rescuers do not waste time while heading to that apartment.
